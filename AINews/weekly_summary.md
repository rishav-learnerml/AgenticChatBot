# Weekly AI News Summary

<think>
Okay, so I need to help summarize these AI news articles into markdown format. Let me see what the user is asking for. They want each item to have the date in YYYY-MM-DD format in IST timezone, a concise summary, sorted by date with the latest first, and the source URL as a link. The format should be ### [Date] followed by a bullet point with the summary and URL.

First, I'll need to go through each article, extract the relevant information, and then structure it properly. Let me start by listing out all the articles with their dates and content.

15. SHRM Article on AI in Workplace - Date: Wed, 20 Aug 2025 15:59:52 GMT

Now, I need to convert these dates from GMT to IST. Since IST is GMT+5:30, I'll add 5 hours and 30 minutes to each date.

Starting with the first one: Fri, 15 Aug 2025 18:15:34 GMT becomes 15 Aug 2025 23:45:34 IST, so the date remains 2025-08-15.

Wait, no, the date in IST is the local date, so when it's Friday in GMT, it would still be Friday in IST, just a bit later. So, the YYYY-MM-DD format would be the same date, just the time is adjusted. So, for each date, I can keep the YYYY-MM-DD as is, just ensuring the time is correct.

Wait, no. Actually, when converting from GMT to IST, the date might change if the time crosses midnight. For example, if a GMT date is 2025-08-15 18:00:00, adding 5h30m would make it 2025-08-16 00:30:00 IST. But the YYYY-MM-DD format is based on the date in IST. So I need to check if any of these cross into the next day.

Let me go through each date:

1. Fri, 15 Aug 2025 18:15:34 GMT +5h30m = Sat, 16 Aug 2025 00:45:34 IST. So the date becomes 2025-08-16.
2. Tue, 19 Aug 2025 03:00:00 GMT +5h30m = Tue, 19 Aug 2025 08:30:00 IST. Date remains 2025-08-19.
3. Fri, 15 Aug 2025 14:34:37 GMT +5h30m = Fri, 15 Aug 2025 20:04:37 IST. Date remains 2025-08-15.
4. Thu, 21 Aug 2025 03:51:54 GMT +5h30m = Thu, 21 Aug 2025 09:21:54 IST. Date remains 2025-08-21.
5. Fri, 22 Aug 2025 05:08:00 GMT +5h30m = Fri, 22 Aug 2025 10:38:00 IST. Date remains 2025-08-22.
6. Thu, 21 Aug 2025 12:35:12 GMT +5h30m = Thu, 21 Aug 2025 18:05:12 IST. Date remains 2025-08-21.
7. Tue, 19 Aug 2025 04:40:44 GMT +5h30m = Tue, 19 Aug 2025 10:10:44 IST. Date remains 2025-08-19.
8. Mon, 18 Aug 2025 14:16:56 GMT +5h30m = Mon, 18 Aug 2025 19:46:56 IST. Date remains 2025-08-18.
9. Sun, 17 Aug 2025 09:47:44 GMT +5h30m = Sun, 17 Aug 2025 15:17:44 IST. Date remains 2025-08-17.
10. Thu, 21 Aug 2025 02:06:06 GMT +5h30m = Thu, 21 Aug 2025 07:36:06 IST. Date remains 2025-08-21.
11. Fri, 15 Aug 2025 15:46:00 GMT +5h30m = Fri, 15 Aug 2025 21:16:00 IST. Date remains 2025-08-15.
12. Fri, 15 Aug 2025 11:37:16 GMT +5h30m = Fri, 15 Aug 2025 17:07:16 IST. Date remains 2025-08-15.
13. Mon, 18 Aug 2025 15:08:21 GMT +5h30m = Mon, 18 Aug 2025 20:38:21 IST. Date remains 2025-08-18.
14. Fri, 15 Aug 2025 12:32:31 GMT +5h30m = Fri, 15 Aug 2025 18:02:31 IST. Date remains 2025-08-15.
15. Wed, 20 Aug 2025 15:59:52 GMT +5h30m = Wed, 20 Aug 2025 21:29:52 IST. Date remains 2025-08-20.

Now, I can list all the dates in IST:

1. 2025-08-16 (from 15th 18:15 GMT)
2. 2025-08-19
3. 2025-08-15
4. 2025-08-21
5. 2025-08-22
6. 2025-08-21
7. 2025-08-19
8. 2025-08-18
9. 2025-08-17
10. 2025-08-21
11. 2025-08-15
12. 2025-08-15
13. 2025-08-18
14. 2025-08-15
15. 2025-08-20

Now, I need to sort them in descending order (latest first). So let's list all the dates:

- 2025-08-22 (1 article)
- 2025-08-21 (3 articles)
- 2025-08-20 (1 article)
- 2025-08-19 (2 articles)
- 2025-08-18 (2 articles)
- 2025-08-17 (1 article)
- 2025-08-16 (1 article)
- 2025-08-15 (4 articles)

Now, I'll go through each article, extract a concise summary, and format it with the date and URL.

1. 2025-08-22: OpenAI to open New Delhi office.
2. 2025-08-21: Maharashtra AI in agriculture, GAIL AI initiative, NHS AI tool.
3. 2025-08-20: SHRM on AI in workplace.
4. 2025-08-19: Google Flight Deals, Adani on AI.
5. 2025-08-18: Fintech fraud detection, Healthcare AI tips.
6. 2025-08-17: Economic Times mention.
7. 2025-08-16: Perplexity offer for Chrome.
8. 2025-08-15: Multiple articles.

Wait, but the Economic Times article seems to be about President's speech, not directly AI, so maybe it's less relevant. I'll include it but note it's more general.

Now, I'll start crafting each entry with the correct date and summary, linking to the URL.

I also need to ensure that the summaries are concise and capture the essence of each article without being too lengthy.

Let me proceed step by step for each article.
